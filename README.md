its a E-commerce website using html css and js and based on local Storage its my first project.
------- how to use ---------

1- open login_page folder in vscode and run  login_page.html with live server extension
2- go to console and clear local storage from typing

```bash
localStorage.clear();
```

3- and now you can make user id admin id and contact me for owner id dont worry its completly free

( the project is not complete like some buttons not working i leave it for students and also make for responsive )

thankyou mam for making me a part of this delta batch.
